# Django companion
Application to help users find a vacation destination and a flight to get there developed as a final project to the conclusion of the Data Analysis course at Ironhack.

## The idea
Travel is one of the most wanted activities during vacation for many people and it is always a lot of fun! However, with so many incredible destinations in the world, it can be tricky to decide where to go and how to arrive there.

## The app
So, that's why the Django Companion app was created: to help you find out where to go to on your next trip based on your preferences and interests. It will also search for available flights so you can get there!

## Libraries required
Pandas, Requests, JSON, AST
